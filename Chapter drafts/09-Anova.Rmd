# The Analysis of Variance Model (ANOVA). 

## Example : A Hand Washing Experiment {-}


Setup

- Four Different Brands.

- 48 Volunteers. 

- Completely Randomized Design.

- Goal:  Compare the four brands of antibacterial soap.


Here are some information about the manufactures and their business models


Brand 1                       |  Brand 2
-----------------------  | ----------------------
![Brand 1](./curcio.jpg){width=34% height=38%}   | ![Brand 2](./ben.jpg){width=35% height=30%} 
I got a great idea to make a lot of money:  just sell water labeled as ‘Antibacterial solution'.      |   Henry’s business is booming, let me also get in the game.  I will beat Henry by adding just a tiny bit of ethanol into the bottle and sell it. 






Here are the summary stats.

Brand 1         Brand 2       Brand 3        Brand 4
--------   --------------   --------------   ------------
Age        14               14
Height     3'2"             3'2"
Politics   Conservative     Conservative
Religion   "New Age"        Syrian Orthodox
---------  --------------   ----------------





Source of variation:


- Within group variance:  Due to random fluctuations

- Between group variance:  Due to the brand of soap + random fluctuations
 
So, let’s take the ratio of the two:

$F – statistic =       \frac{Between \ group \ variance}{Within\ group\ variance}$

Note:  Creator was R.A. Fisher, hence the letter ‘F’ in honor of him.
