# Preface {-}
This book grew out of my class notes in Stat-2 and my observations of other instructors around the world. I claim no originality in my thoughts or examples.  Almost all of them are influenced, shaped, and refined by listening to other people. I thank ALL of them for their inspiring lectures and insightful examples which made this work possible.
